Yes:

  recipes: [
    ...array of RecipeProbe monitors to run...
    Each element has an order value, to insert into the setRule
  ]

Recipe:
  One trigger         : Currently defined by RecipeProbe.triggeredBy
    + trigger script
  One action

Trigger
  A probe with specific attribute values
    (ultimately a script triggered on any change of the
     above probe that returns true)
  Any probe attributes & user defined values

  garageProbe:
    lightSwitchOn: true

Action
  Any probe that has a 'run' control

ActionSequence recipe:
  * Triggered by regular recipe triggers (cron/at/attribute)
  * Array of:
    * Action (switch settings)
    * Delay
    * Action
    * Delay
    * End or Repeat



I want a scheduler that knows the position of a control
at any moment of time

SchedulerRecipe?  Recipe triggered every second?
* What value does it have as a recipe?
  * Generic inclusion in list of recipes
* One scheduler per control attribute?
* One scheduler per control probe? (yes)
* One scheduler per room?
* Schedulers can control any attribute
* One-time schedulers (at a higher order than all-time schedulers)
* Scheduler instances

* Action sequences
  * Starting state
  * Array of timeout, followed by state change

How to represent triggers?
  * As recipes

How to represent actions (as code)?
  * Script (default recipeProbe)
    * Probe control methods (w/params - via script)

How to represent actions (as data)?
  * In the recipe probe definition
    * As actionDef attributes?

  ScriptAction: Run a script on a (set of) probes

Ultimately, he-env is monitor-dashboard
---------------------------------------
* Want these features
  * Data driven site
  * Node-monitor integration
  * Standardized component add-ons
  * Tours
  * About w/add-ons

* Dashboard improvements
  * Responsive, fluid layout
  * Sidebar goes to menu
  * Depth is hidden
  * Page Templates (like Grafina)
  * Update dependencies
  * SIMPLIFY (remove backbone bubbling)

But FOR NOW, it's a 1 page mobile app
